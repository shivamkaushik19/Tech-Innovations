          <p class="intro-text">
              Facebook, X (Twitter), Instagram and many other social media channels are simply a part of daily life for millions—in fact, billions—of us. 
              The ubiquitous use of Facebook extends to more than a quarter of the earth’s population—that’s more than 2 billion active users.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">
              With such a far-reaching scope, it’s no wonder that these networks have become such a valuable tool for businesses. If you’re not posting on Facebook, trending on X (Twitter) or sharing pictures on Instagram, you’re missing out on vital visibility for your business.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">
              Effective social media marketing is about much more than just posting and understanding proper optimization on social networks is a nuanced and delicate thing. 
              What works for one brand may not be best for your brand—but that’s where we can help.
          </p>
  
          <h2 class="section-heading">What is Social Media Marketing?</h2>
          <p class="intro-text">
              Social media marketing is a digital method used by businesses to connect with customers, earn brand awareness, and easily promote services and products 
              where users are spending most of their time: scrolling through their feeds. By being active on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest, 
              you’re making your business more approachable and accessible to a wider audience, while also maintaining a good social presence—a vital part of your digital success.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">
              Despite what you may think, social media marketing does not mean being on every social network that exists. Like we said, it’s all about what works for your brand. 
              Thinking about the story you want to tell, your brand image, and where you think you can connect best with your target audience will help lead you to the social 
              media platforms that make sense for your business—could be one, could be three! Whether you’re treating it as a direct line to your support team, a lead generation tool, 
              or everything in between, our social media marketing services can help you achieve your business goals.
